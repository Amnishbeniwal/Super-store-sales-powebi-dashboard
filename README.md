📊 Super Store Sales Dashboard – Power BI

This Power BI dashboard provides a complete analysis of Super Store sales performance using historical data and short-term forecasting. It helps understand sales trends, profit patterns, customer behavior, and regional performance in an interactive and visual way.

🧩 Business Problem Solved

The Super Store was facing difficulty in understanding sales performance and profit trends across different regions, product categories, and customer segments. Business stakeholders did not have a single dashboard to answer key questions such as:

Which categories and sub-categories generate the most sales and profit?

Which states and regions are underperforming?

How do sales and profits change over time?

Which customer segment contributes the most revenue?

What will be the expected sales in the next few days?

Because of this, decision-making was slow and mostly based on raw data instead of insights.

✅ Solution Provided

This dashboard solves the problem by:

Converting raw sales data into clear visual insights

Tracking sales, profit, orders, and shipping performance

Identifying high-performing and low-performing regions

Analyzing monthly sales and profit trends

Providing a 15-day sales forecast to support short-term planning

As a result, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions for inventory planning, marketing strategy, and regional performance improvement.
